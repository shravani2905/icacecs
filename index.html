          ICACECS 2024<br><br>
          The Department of Computer Science & Engineering, VNR VJIET, successfully organized a 2-Day International Conference “International Conference on Advances in Computer Engineering and Communication Systems (ICACECS)" (ICACECS 2020, ICACECS 2021, ICACECS 2022, and ICACECS 2023) consecutively for 4 years. This conference is conducted in association with “Springer Nature International” the publication partner and technically sponsored by the Computer Society of India (CSI). Every year there was an overwhelming response from researchers around the globe publishing their research contributions in “Smart Innovations in Mezzanine Technologies, Data Analytics, Knowledge Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Networks and Communication Systems” - the theme of the conference.<br><br>
  
          Continuing this legacy, the international conference ICACECS 2024 is now scheduled to be conducted on 8th & 9th August 2024.<br><br>
  
          This year, ICACECS 2024 is also co-located at THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES(UWI), AT MONA, JAMAICA. UWI Mona, Jamaica is the founding campus of the unique, multi-part, multi-national University of the West Indies. The square mile site welcomed its first undergraduates – 33 medical students from across the West Indies or now, more often, the Caribbean – in October 1948. The UWI is the region’s premier educational institution, with faculties offering a wide range of undergraduate, masters and doctoral programmes in Humanities and Education, Science and Technology, Science and Agriculture, Engineering, Law, Medical Sciences and Social Sciences. Mohan Babu University is a State Private University promoted by Sree Vidyanikethan Educational Trust under the leadership of Dr. M. Mohan Babu, Ex Rajyasabha Member, Producer, Cine Artiste and a great Philanthropist. The University is located in Tirupati, Chittoor District, Andhra Pradesh, India. Mohan Babu University promotes excellence in all the frontiers of Engineering, Pharmacy, Liberal Arts & Sciences, Agriculture, Education, Journalism, Management, Performing and Arts, MB Film Academy, Paramedical and Health Sciences. MBU’s advanced curriculum, expert mentorship, best-in-class facilities with a safe 5-star rated campus, and 65+ clubs are poised to help students innovate, learn and lead the next, today. In a constantly changing world, only talent that is future-ready can take the baton ahead. Therefore, MBU focuses on delivering a unique blend of academic brilliance, discipline, and dynamism. Groomed in such an inspiring culture, a community of thousands of students is preparing for a future of success. We are pleased to see them soar high with rewarding opportunities in companies like Google and Amazon this academic year. We are confident that each one of our students is nurtured and well-supported to make a difference in a unique way.<br><br>
  
          Authors are solicited to contribute their submissions illustrating research results and innovations, and significant advances in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Natural Language Processing, Smart Systems, Networks, and Communication Systems, Quantum computing, Knowledge Engineering and Ontology, Internet of Things, Education Technology, and Business Engineering.<br><br>
  
          ICACECS 2024 is a unique forum bringing together scholars from different countries to participate and transform the Research Landscape of the globe and carve a Road Map for Implementation. It provides a valuable networking opportunity and brings a new era for the Research scholars, Students, Professors, Industrialists providing insights into the recent trends and developments in the field of Computer Science with a special focus on Mezzanine technologies.<br><br>
